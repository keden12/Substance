# Substance

This is an app created using AngularJS. Features include a ranking system, comments, description and specs of each substance. You can also add a new substance, set all the values and description of the new substance and also rank the substance. If you rank the newly added substance to be on a spot that another substance is currently at (lets say you set the rank to 1), this means that all other substances will change their position depending on which rank the added substance was set to. There is also a search/filter feature in the app.
